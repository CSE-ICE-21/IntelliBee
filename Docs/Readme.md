# Intellibee

## Overview

**Intellibee** is a smart monitoring system that prioritizes both honey yield and colony wellness. Using a network of sensors and advanced algorithms, Intellibee continuously analyzes hive conditions, bee behavior, and environmental factors to detect early signs of health issues, predict honey flow, and provide actionable insights to beekeepers.
